## PlantTraits2024
This competition aims to classify six essential plant traits using crowdsourced images and structured plant data [1]. Plant traits are measurable characteristics that describe a plant's function and environmental interactions. Analyzing plant traits provides crucial insights into global biodiversity patterns and how plant ecosystems may adapt to the effects of climate change.  Ideally, these traits would be measured directly, but this is impractical on a large scale.  By extracting traits from image and tabular data, this approach facilitates the broader study of plant resilience in a changing climate [2].
